  <div class="a">
    Freedom is it!
  <br>You’re so scared, you want to lock up everybody.</br>
    <b>Are they mad dogs?</b>
      <br><b>Are they out to kill?</b>
      <br>Maybe yes.</br></div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="b">
      <br><b>Is law, is order the solution?</b>
      <br>Definitely No.
      <br><b>What caused this situation?</b>
      <br>Lack of freedom.
      <br><b>What happens now?</b>
      <br>Let people fulfill their needs.</br></div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="c"><b>Is freedom constructive or is it destructive?</b>
      <br>The answer is obvious.
      <br>Free people are good, productive people.
      <br><b>Is liberation dangerous?</b>
      <br>Only when overdue.
      <br>People aren’t born rabid or berserk.
      <br>When you punish and shame you cause what you dread.</div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="d"<br><b>What to do?</b>
      <br>Let it explode.
      <br>Run with it.
      <br>Don’t control or manipulate.
      <br>Make amends.</div>
